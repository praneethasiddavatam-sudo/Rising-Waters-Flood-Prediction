# Rising-Water-Flood-Prediction-ML
# Flood Warning Prediction

Detects flood risk percentage and issues warnings to local people

A machine learning-based flood warning system that analyzes environmental data to estimate the probability of flooding and provides early alerts to help communities prepare and respond effectively.

# Overview

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, especially in monsoon-prone regions This project uses machine learning techniques to:

Predict the likelihood of flooding based on input features such as rainfall, water level, humidity, etc

Estimate flood percentage — how likely a flood event is to occur

Warn local residents or authorities when flood risk crosses a defined threshold

It can support early preparation and potentially reduce loss of life and property

# Features

 Predicts flood probability (%) for a given region
 Simple user interface for prediction and warnings
 Uses a trained ML model (e.g., classification/regression)
 Can be extended with real-time data feeds (e.g., rainfall API)
